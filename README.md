# Problem Set 5

In this final problem set, you will get to explore a different programming language of your choice and make your own unique creation using an application of Java, such as Processing, JavaFX, or Android!

## Problem 5-0: OOP Comparison

Write 1-2 paragraphs (6-10 sentences) comparing object-oriented programming Java and another language that supports OOP.

Suggested languages:

* Python - practical; lots of science/math applications
* PHP - quirky; useful in web development
* JavaScript - limited OOP; relevant to web development
* C++ - a little vintage; relevant for graphics and games
* Swift - robust OOP; language that powers iPhones
* Any other language with OOP that you are curious about!

Points of comparison (try to touch on each of these as your language choices allow):

* Use of the this/self keyword
* Inheritance (Is it a feature? Syntax for calling methods, calling to super, overriding? Is multiple inheritance allowed? Are there abstract classes?)
* Static properties and methods (Are they allowed?)
* Stylistic conventions (e.g. capitalizing class names, underscores, etc)
* Other language quirks you find in your research (e.g. lazy stored properties & setter/getter shortcuts in Swift)

Cite your sources -- just URLs are OK.

## Problem 5-1: Free Create

Make a small project of your choice using one of the Java applications we have learned! Your project should be based in either JavaFX, Processing, or Android.

Requirements:

* Projects should go beyond in-class labs.
* Projects should be cohesive and have a unifying concept (e.g. instead of random shapes and events in Processing, make a game or recognizable picture).
* **JavaFX** projects should have a layout (VBox, HBox, GridPane), at least two buttons, and at least two colors. You will likely do additional research for JavaFX.
* **Processing** projects should use a loop, random, at least three shapes, at least two colors, at least one event (e.g. keyPressed), and a text element.
* **Android** projects should use at least two of the following features: animations, sound, slider, ListView, timer, a second activity, maps, data persistence. (We'll cover all of these in class.) For example, you could make a Whack a Mole game with a timer and score, a pomodoro timer, or a travel app.

If you do additional research, cite your sources -- just URLs are OK. You can add them to the comments.

## Extra Credit: Simon Game

Recreate the classic Simon Game with Java on Processing or Android!

First, play the [Simon Game](http://www.freesimon.org/) online to get an idea of how it works.

The requirements for your game will be a little simpler. Your game should:

* Display four large buttons representing the four colors of the game (green, red, yellow, blue).
* Have a "GO" button that the user can press to start.
* When the game first loads, it should display a text message saying four colors to press in a certain order. Colors can be repeated! Example: "red, blue, yellow, yellow."
* When the user hits the "GO" button, the text with the colors should disappear.
* As the user presses the color buttons, the program should track whether the user pressed the buttons in the same order as the original text.
* When the color buttons have been pressed four times, the program should report whether the user got the pattern correct or not. (You can even keep score!)
* Repeat!
